The function checkIfInstanceOf takes two parameters: obj (the value to be checked) and classFunction (the class or superclass against which the check needs to be performed).
​
The code first checks if obj is null, undefined, or if classFunction is not a function. If any of these conditions are true, it means the input is not valid for the check, so the function returns false.
​
If the input is valid, the code creates an input_object by using the Object() constructor with obj as the argument. This step ensures that input_object is an object, even if obj is a primitive value.
​
Finally, the code checks if input_object is an instance of classFunction using the instanceof operator. If input_object is indeed an instance of classFunction, the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
​
In summary, the code checks if a given value (obj) is an instance of a given class (classFunction). It handles cases where the input is invalid or when the input is a valid object, it checks if it is an instance of the specified class using the instanceof operator.
