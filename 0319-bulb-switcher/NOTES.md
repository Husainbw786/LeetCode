the main logic behind this code is that
for every number we will calculate its factor if the factor is even then the bulb will be off at the end. If the factors are odd then the bulb will be on.
for eg assume their are 6 bulbs
1      [1]
2      [1,2]
3      [1,3]
4      [1,2,4]
5      [1,5]
6      [1,2,3,6]
if we carefully observe then we will find that the number having factors of odd count are perfect square.
int above example 1 add 4 are perfect square
to calculate perfect sqaures in range 1 to n
simply do square root of n.
